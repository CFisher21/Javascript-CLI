# Javascript-CLI
A project I worked on while at Keyin College. This was to make a command line interface that allowed a user to save different types of data to different types of data formats (.txt, .json). CRC (Cyclic redundancy check) was used here to encrypt the passwords being saved.

1. Open with Visual Studio Code
2. run *npm install* in the console to install the node modules files.
3. in the terminal CD into the js folder.
4. run the command *node app init --all* to initialize the project files.
5. use the help files in the help folder to further use the application.

Any issues with getting this app to run please email me at fishercody23@gmail.com
